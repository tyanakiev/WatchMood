This app answers only one question: __What should I watch now?__


So in this _rare_ occasions, when you have time for a movie but you don't know which one, just push a button or two and there you go.


## User Story:

In order do decide what to watch in my free time

As a user I want to be able very quickly based on just 3 movies

To receive one suggestion that I will definitely enjoy

And if I have watched the suggested movie to be able to rate it in a scale 1-5

And based on my rating plus my previous top 3 movies to receive new suggestion


## Action Plan

### Building Minimal Viable Product
#### The aim here is to getter important information from users - validated learning, by building a usable product with minimal effort and making it accessible to everyone

1. Create a mockup on the main page;
2. Review and decide - the layout, the front end technical implementation;
3. Decide the back end technical implementation - database and communication with front end only;
4. Build a site based on the user story, that will pick a random movie - no calculations are needed at this point;
5. Deploy on production;
6. Set Google Analytics in order to collect user data;
7. Work on Search Engine optimization;
8. Inspection - collect enough information;
9. Have a beer or two;
10. Adaptation - make changes starting from step 3;
